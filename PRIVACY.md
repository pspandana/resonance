# Privacy Policy for Resonance

**Last Updated:** October 15, 2025

## In Simple Words

Resonance helps you understand articles better. Here's what happens with your data:

### What We Collect

When you use Resonance:
- **Article text** - We read the article you're looking at (only when you click our icon)
- **Your questions** - The questions you ask about articles
- **Conversation history** - Your past chats (saved on YOUR computer, not our servers)

### Where It Goes

- **Article + Questions** → Sent to our server → Sent to OpenAI (the AI company) → Gets an answer → Comes back to you
- **Conversation history** → Stays on YOUR computer only (never leaves your device)

### Why We Need It

- To understand the article and answer your questions accurately
- To remember your past conversations (so you can review them later)

### What We DON'T Do

❌ We don't sell your data  
❌ We don't share it with advertisers  
❌ We don't require you to create an account  
❌ We don't track you across websites  
❌ We don't see your browsing history  

### How We Protect It

✅ All data sent over secure HTTPS (encrypted)  
✅ Conversation history only on your device  
✅ We only process data when you explicitly click our extension  

### Your Rights

You can:
- Delete your conversation history anytime (click History → clear)
- Stop using the extension anytime
- Email us with questions: [your-email@example.com]

### Third Parties

We use:
- **OpenAI** - To power the AI responses
- **Azure** - To host our backend server

Both follow their own privacy policies and security standards.

### Changes

If we update this policy, we'll post the new version here with a new date.
